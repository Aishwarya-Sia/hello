Problem:i was not able to install any application using ubuntu terminal sudo app-get install command.it give me following error.

error while dual booting :
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?

Solution:

You can delete the lock file with the following command:

	sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock

You may also need to delete the lock file in the cache directory

	sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
	sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
After that, try opening Synaptic again.
